            The document “IHO S121 Feature Model for Maritime Limits and Boundaries” was distributed at the initial meeting of the IHO S-121 Project Team meeting held in December 2016, New York, United Nations Head Quarters. After that meeting, in an effort to define the core features of the standard, a first draft of the Core Features was provided by UN-DOALOS (See Appendix C).  
      </p>
      <p>
        Member countries were then requested to provide comments on this draft document. As a result a number of comments were received and have been compiled and were sorted by topic areas. The comments, of course, address all aspects of the standards and were not limited to the S-121 Core Feature Objects. The comment table found in Appendix A gathers and support the description of all comments. This table indicates which comments the editor proposes for adoption and which ones need further discussion. This table is structured using the ISO commenting template.
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to address the comments, it is proposed to address the S-121 Feature Objects first. After the committee has tentatively agreed on the S-121 Core Feature Objects, it is then proposed to address other topics such as attributes, the relation to the Rights, Restrictions and Responsibility and Party structure inherited from ISO and some of the more general issues. Hopefully when the Feature Objects are agreed some of the other issues may disappear.
      </p>
      <p>
        Member States of the S-121 Project Team are requested to review the revised table in Appendix A in preparation for the May teleconference and provide additional comments on this table or on the proposed resolution of comments. Please use the template table.
      </p>
    <p>
        Of course member nations may also submit additional comments on the original document if need be. A revised version of the original document will be provided at a later time.
      </p>
      <p>
      Hopefully this process of incrementally addressing the comments and soliciting feedback will allow the project team to come to an agreement in the near future on the basic Feature Objects, then attributes and the remaining structure will be covered.
