            The document “IHO S121 Feature Model for Maritime Limits and Boundaries” was distributed at the initial meeting of
        the IHO S-121 Project Team meeting held in December 2016, New York, United Nations Head Quarters. After that meeting, 
        in an effort to define the core features of the standard, a first draft of the Core Features was provided by UN-DOALOS 
        (See Appendix C).  
      </p>
      <p>
        Member countries were then requested to provide comments on this draft document. As a result a number of comments were 
        received and have been compiled and were sorted by topic areas. The comments, of course, address all aspects of the 
        standards and were not limited to the S-121 Core Feature Objects. The comment table found in Appendix A gathers and 
        support the description of all comments. This table indicates which comments the editor proposes for adoption and which 
        ones need further discussion. This table is structured using the ISO commenting template.
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to address the comments, it is proposed to address the S-121 Feature Objects first. After the committee has 
        tentatively agreed on the S-121 Core Feature Objects, it is then proposed to address other topics such as attributes, 
        the relation to the Rights, Restrictions and Responsibility and Party structure inherited from ISO and some of the more 
        general issues. Hopefully when the Feature Objects are agreed some of the other issues may disappear.
      </p>
      <p>
        Member States of the S-121 Project Team are requested to review the revised table in Appendix A in preparation for 
        the May teleconference and provide additional comments on this table or on the proposed resolution of comments. 
        Please use the template table.
      </p>
    <p>
        Of course member nations may also submit additional comments on the original document if need be. A revised version 
      of the original document will be provided at a later time.
      </p>
      <p>
      Hopefully this process of incrementally addressing the comments and soliciting feedback will allow the project team 
        to come to an agreement in the near future on the basic Feature Objects, then attributes and the remaining structure 
        will be covered.

      <h2>Context</h2>
      <p>
The mandate of this project team addresses real and reflects deep differences in the policies of States in how they 
        apply the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea; how they give legal force domestically to their boundaries limits and 
        zones; the role that they see the standard fulfilling in the administration of their marine space and the role of 
        hydrography in all of these.  
      </p>
      <p>
        With so much history and so many interests, the establishment of the project team was the 
        formalization of a process that had been in train for at least a decade at the IHO and decades for many 
        States. The challenge is to bring the various strands of this problem together in a way that develops and serves 
        the needs of the whole community.   Negotiating these complexities whilst being respectful of each other, while 
        addressing the needs of States, and the needs of the international community is the character of the Project Team’s mandate.       
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li> The Value of the Standard Cannot Be Overstated</li>        
      </ul>
      <p>
      Access to authoritative information on the location of a State’s marine entitlements and the agreements that 
        States make to accommodate their competing interest is fundamental to the peace and security of the World’s oceans.  
        The deposit and due publicity of this information with the Secretary General of the United Nations is the mechanism 
        established by various provisions of the Convention to achieve this goal.  Making this information available electronically 
        in a standard based format is an important part of keeping the processes that support the Convention consistent with 
        current technologies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Domestically, the accurate and legally authoritative realization of a State limits and boundaries is the cornerstone of the administration of its marine space.  This standard has the potential, if properly designed, to be the foundation of a framework for managing not just the national boundaries, but the subsidiary zones that depend upon them.

      <p><dfn>Straight Baseline</dfn>:a baseline.</p>
      <p><dfn>Normal Baseline</dfn>: a straight baseline.</p>
      <p><dfn>Archipelagic Baseline</dfn>; Coordinate Reference System (CRS)</dfn>: A coordinate system to locate entities of interest with respect to an object using a <a>datum</a>  [[ISO-19111]]. If the entities of interest and the object and datum are in the real world, the CRS is a <em>Spatial Reference System</em> (SRS). If the object is the Earth, the SRS is a <em>Geo-Spatial Reference System</em> (GRS). A GRS may be local, regional or global in scope. An example of a CRS that is not a SRS is the wavelength of a signal in the electromagnetic spectrum.</p>

<p><dfn>Limit</dfn>: The Limit object is a generic object that defines any limits or boundaries either relating to terrestrial, marine or both environments.
<p><dfn>Zone</dfn>:   The Zone object is a generic object that defines an area which is logically delimited by instances of delineation (limit) objects. 
<p><dfn>Space</dfn>:  The Space object is a generic object that defines a volume which is logically delimited by instances of zone objects.
<p><dfn>Limit Point</dfn>:  A limit point is a point on the outer limit of a maritime zone
<p><dfn>Boundary Point</dfn>:   A boundary point is a point on a boundary line between two or more States.
<p><dfn>Baseline Point</dfn>:   A baseline point is a point on (i) a baseline from which the breadths of the territorial sea, contiguous zone, exclusive economic zone, and continental shelf (up to 200 nautical miles) are measured, or (ii) on an archipelagic baseline.
<p><dfn>Boundary</dfn>:   Boundary is a delimitation line between two or more entities, determined by agreement or through a third-party dispute settlement mechanism.
<p><dfn>International Boundary</dfn>:   International boundary is a delimitation line between two or more coastal States with adjacent or opposite coasts, determined by agreement or through a third-party dispute settlement mechanism. 
<p><dfn>Baseline</dfn>:   Baseline as per Articles 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14 and 47 of UNCLOS
<p><dfn>Outer Limit of the Territorial Sea</dfn>:   Outer Limit of the Territorial Sea as per Articles 3 and 4 of UNCLOS
<p><dfn>Normal Baseline</dfn>:  Normal Baseline as per Articles 5, 6 and 13 of UNCLOS
<p><dfn>Reef Baseline</dfn>:  Reef Baseline as per Article 6 of UNCLOS
<p><dfn>Straight Baseline</dfn>:  Straight Baseline as per Article 7 of UNCLOS
<p><dfn>Mouth of River Baseline</dfn>:  Mouth of River Baseline as per Article 9 of UNCLOS
<p><dfn>Bay Baseline</dfn>:   Bay Baseline as per Article 10 of UNCLOS
